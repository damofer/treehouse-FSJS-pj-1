In this project, you'll create a random quote generator to display quotations on the screen after a button on the page is clicked. For example, display a quote from a famous athlete, politician, or historical figure like:

"The only thing to fear is fear itself." â€” Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
You'll need to use your knowledge of basic JavaScript syntax including variables, loops and object literals to complete this project.

We'll give you basic HTML and CSS as well a JavaScript file containing some code to help you get started. But you'll have to find the quotes yourself and build the data structure to store them in.

This project is a great way for you to practice fundamental JavaScript skills. Its also gives you a simple interactive portfolio project you can use to show off your understanding of JavaScript.

When you're done, you'll put your finished project on GitHub, an important tool used by millions of developers to help share code and work collaboratively on programming projects. Creating and using a GitHub account is also a great way to share your work with potential employers.
